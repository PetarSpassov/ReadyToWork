# ReadyToWork
A Northgard mod which replaces the villager click effect with WC3's "Ready to Work!"

## __Disclaimer__
None of the assets used in this mod belong to me. All credit and rights go to the creators of Northgard, Shiro Games. This mod is merely a harmless modification of game files meant to be used in solo and cooperative play.

## __Installation__
Download `res1.pak` and place it within your Northgard folder. For Steam, this would look something like this: `X\Steam\steamapps\common\Northgard`

You can easily reach it by right-clicking the game in your Steam Library and pressing `Manage -> Browse local files`. You should now have `res.client.pak` and `res.client1.pak`.

NOTE: If you already have a `res.client1.pak`, you will need to rename this one to `res.client2.pak`. The game reads `res.client.pak` files in numerical order, starting from `res.client.pak` -> `res.client1.pak` -> `res.client2.pak`, etc. If you have `res.client.pak` and `res.client2.pak`, the game will NOT load `res.client2.pak`.

## __Uninstallation__
Simply delete `res.client1.pak` (or whatever you named this pak) from the folder to remove the mod.
